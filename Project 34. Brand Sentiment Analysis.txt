Project 834. Brand Sentiment Analysis

Brand sentiment analysis evaluates how people feel about a brand across social media, reviews, or survey data. In this project, we'll simulate tweets or customer opinions and use sentiment analysis to classify public opinion as positive, negative, or neutral.

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation using TextBlob:

import pandas as pd
from textblob import TextBlob
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simulated brand-related tweets or comments
comments = [
    "I love this brand! The new collection is amazing.",
    "Terrible customer service. Will not buy again.",
    "Product is okay, not too great, not too bad.",
    "Excellent experience with support team!",
    "The quality has really gone down recently.",
    "Fast delivery and great packaging.",
    "Not worth the money at all.",
    "Their app is super smooth and easy to use.",
    "Pretty average, nothing special.",
    "Worst return process I've ever experienced."
]

# Create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'Comment': comments})

# Classify sentiment using polarity score
def get_sentiment(text):
    polarity = TextBlob(text).sentiment.polarity
    if polarity > 0.2:
        return 'Positive'
    elif polarity < -0.2:
        return 'Negative'
    else:
        return 'Neutral'

# Apply sentiment classifier
df['Sentiment'] = df['Comment'].apply(get_sentiment)

# Show sentiment analysis results
print("Brand Sentiment Analysis:")
print(df)

# Visualize sentiment distribution
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
df['Sentiment'].value_counts().plot(kind='bar', color='coral')
plt.title('Brand Sentiment Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Sentiment')
plt.ylabel('Number of Mentions')
plt.grid(axis='y')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
This script processes customer opinions and classifies them using polarity scores into sentiment buckets. It can help brands monitor perception, track campaigns, or benchmark against competitors. For deeper insights, it can be upgraded with BERT-based sentiment models or aspect-based analysis.
