Project 817. Process Optimization Model

A process optimization model improves operational efficiency by adjusting process parameters to maximize output or minimize cost. In this example, we'll simulate a production process and use constrained optimization to find the best input combination for maximum output while respecting resource limits.

Here’s the Python implementation using scipy.optimize:

from scipy.optimize import minimize
import numpy as np

# Objective: maximize production output
# Production function: output = 5*x1 + 8*x2 (x1, x2 are input units)
# Convert to minimization problem by negating the objective
def objective(x):
    return -1 * (5 * x[0] + 8 * x[1])  # maximize output

# Constraints:
# 1. Total labor available = 40 units
# 2. Total material available = 60 units
# Labor: x1 uses 1 unit, x2 uses 2 units
# Material: x1 uses 2 units, x2 uses 1 unit
constraints = [
    {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x: 40 - (1 * x[0] + 2 * x[1])},  # labor constraint
    {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x: 60 - (2 * x[0] + 1 * x[1])}   # material constraint
]

# Bounds: cannot use negative input units
bounds = [(0, None), (0, None)]  # x1, x2 ≥ 0

# Initial guess
x0 = [0, 0]

# Solve the optimization problem
result = minimize(objective, x0, method='SLSQP', bounds=bounds, constraints=constraints)

# Display results
if result.success:
    x1, x2 = result.x
    max_output = -result.fun
    print(f"Optimal Inputs: x1 = {x1:.2f}, x2 = {x2:.2f}")
    print(f"Maximum Output: {max_output:.2f}")
else:
    print("Optimization failed:", result.message)
This model finds the optimal mix of inputs (x1 and x2) to maximize production, constrained by labor and material availability. In real cases, such models can optimize multi-stage processes, energy use, or even AI inference pipelines.
