Project 835. Competitive Intelligence System

A competitive intelligence system gathers and analyzes public data about competitors to gain strategic insights. This project simulates scraping competitor news, product updates, or pricing changes and then performs keyword analysis and topic detection to extract trends.

Hereâ€™s the Python implementation using basic text processing:

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from wordcloud import WordCloud
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simulated news and updates from competitor websites or press releases
documents = [
    "Competitor A launches AI-powered analytics dashboard.",
    "Competitor B announces price reduction on core SaaS product.",
    "Competitor A partners with cloud provider for global expansion.",
    "Competitor C introduces real-time customer support feature.",
    "Competitor B expands into European market with new tools.",
    "Competitor C raises funding to enhance AI capabilities."
]

# Create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'Update': documents})

# Extract keyword frequencies using CountVectorizer
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['Update'])
word_freq = pd.DataFrame(X.toarray(), columns=vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
total_freq = word_freq.sum().sort_values(ascending=False)

# Display top keywords
print("Top Competitive Intelligence Keywords:")
print(total_freq.head(10))

# Generate word cloud for visual pattern recognition
wordcloud = WordCloud(width=800, height=400, background_color='white').generate_from_frequencies(total_freq)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')
plt.axis('off')
plt.title('Competitor Activity Word Cloud')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
This basic system extracts high-frequency keywords from text updates to help identify competitor focus areas like "AI," "expansion," or "support." You can extend this with web scraping, named entity recognition (NER), trend graphs, and alerting.
